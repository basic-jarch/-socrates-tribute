        <h3>Here's a List of Socrates' Contributions to the World:</h3>
        </div>
         <div class="list">
           <ul>
             <li> I. <strong>Socratic Technique</strong> - Socrates’ most important contribution to Western philosophy was his technique for arguing a point, known as the Socratic technique, which he applied to many things such as truth and justice.</li><br>
             <li> II. <strong>Philosophical Beliefs</strong> - The beliefs of Socrates, separate from those of Plato, are hard to define as little in the way of solid proof exists to separate the two. The vast majority of Plato’s “exchanges” might be simply the thoughts of Socrates reinterpreted by Plato, and several researchers think Plato adapted the Socratic style to make Socrates and the other characters difficult to recognize. Others contend that he had his own hypotheses and beliefs.</li><br>
             <li> III. <strong>Socratic Paradoxes</strong> - A significant number of the beliefs generally credited to Socrates are deliberately confusing because they present ideas which, at first, appear contradictory. These are called paradoxes. The most famous paradox is: “I know that I know nothing“.
In that paradox Socrates claims that he knows nothing, but if that’s true, then how could he even know that he knows nothing.
The expression “catch 22” can be applied to all of Socrates’ paradoxes, as problems which cannot be easily solved as they do not have an obvious answer..</li><br>
             <li> IV. <strong>Learning</strong> -  Socrates believed that in order to come to a conclusion, a person needed to approach it with “thought, sense, judgment, viable knowledge, [and] prudence.” He also believed that bad behavior was the result of ignorance, and those who made mistakes did so because they knew no better.

The one thing Socrates did profess to know about was “the specialty of affection.” This is related to the word erôtan, which means to ask questions, showing that Socrates linked the ideas of love and posing questions about it.</li><br>
             <li> V. <strong>Righteousness</strong> - Socrates believed that people should strive for goodness rather than material interests such as wealth. He encouraged others to focus more on companionship and making connections with other people because he felt this was the ideal path for individuals to come together as a group. He bears this idea out when he calmly accepts his own death sentence. Rather than fleeing to live a life alone and in exile, he accepts his punishment from society for going against the general beliefs of the population.</li><br>
             <li>VI. <strong>Governmental Issues</strong> - Socrates’ resistance to the vote-based system is often disputed, and the question is frequently posed during philosophical discussions when trying to establish exactly what Socrates did and did not believe. The most compelling evidence that Socrates did not believe in democracy is in Plato’s Republic, although this is generally viewed as a second-hand account through the “exchanges.” In Plato’s Apology, Socrates is seen not to pursue regular legislative issues, frequently expressing that he could not advise individuals how to experience their lives when he didn’t yet see how to experience his own.</li><br>
